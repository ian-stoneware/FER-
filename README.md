# FER-Classification Task

This project investigates the effect of various **learning rate (LR) scheduling strategies** on model performance for **Facial Expression Recognition (FER)**. All schedulers were initialized with a learning rate of **0.01**.

## üìä LR Scheduling Strategies

| Scheduler                  | Description |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| **ReduceLROnPlateau**     | Reduces LR by a factor of **0.75** when validation accuracy stops improving for **5 epochs**, allowing adaptive fine-tuning. |
| **StepLR**                | Reduces LR by **50% every 20 epochs**, offering a simple, periodic schedule. |
| **OneCycleLR**            | Uses a cyclic policy: increases LR to a peak and then anneals, enabling **faster convergence**. |
| **CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts** | Applies cosine annealing with **warm restarts every 10 epochs** to help the optimizer escape local minima. |
